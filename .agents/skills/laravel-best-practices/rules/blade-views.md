> ⛔ **DATABASE SAFETY (river-notetaker) — read `DATABASE_SAFETY.md`.** NEVER run `php artisan migrate:fresh`, `migrate:refresh`, `migrate:reset`, `db:wipe`, or `migrate --seed`. NEVER drop, truncate, delete, or overwrite `database/database.sqlite` — it is gitignored, has **no backup**, and holds the user's real work; it has been wiped repeatedly and every wipe cost real data. Use `php artisan migrate` (additive) only. `php artisan test` uses in-memory sqlite and is safe. A full rebuild is the **user's** job, by hand — if one seems necessary, STOP and ask.

# Blade & Views Best Practices

## Use `$attributes->merge()` in Component Templates

Hardcoding classes prevents consumers from adding their own. `merge()` combines class attributes cleanly.

```blade
<div {{ $attributes->merge(['class' => 'alert alert-'.$type]) }}>
    {{ $message }}
</div>
```

## Use `@pushOnce` for Per-Component Scripts

If a component renders inside a `@foreach`, `@push` inserts the script N times. `@pushOnce` guarantees it's included exactly once.

## Prefer Blade Components Over `@include`

`@include` shares all parent variables implicitly (hidden coupling). Components have explicit props, attribute bags, and slots.

## Use View Composers for Shared View Data

If every controller rendering a sidebar must pass `$categories`, that's duplicated code. A View Composer centralizes it.

## Use Blade Fragments for Partial Re-Renders (htmx/Turbo)

A single view can return either the full page or just a fragment, keeping routing clean.

```php
return view('dashboard', compact('users'))
    ->fragmentIf($request->hasHeader('HX-Request'), 'user-list');
```

## Use `@aware` for Deeply Nested Component Props

Avoids re-passing parent props through every level of nested components.
