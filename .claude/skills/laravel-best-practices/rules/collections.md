> ⛔ **DATABASE SAFETY (river-notetaker) — read `DATABASE_SAFETY.md`.** NEVER run `php artisan migrate:fresh`, `migrate:refresh`, `migrate:reset`, `db:wipe`, or `migrate --seed`. NEVER drop, truncate, delete, or overwrite `database/database.sqlite` — it is gitignored, has **no backup**, and holds the user's real work; it has been wiped repeatedly and every wipe cost real data. Use `php artisan migrate` (additive) only. `php artisan test` uses in-memory sqlite and is safe. A full rebuild is the **user's** job, by hand — if one seems necessary, STOP and ask.

# Collection Best Practices

## Use Higher-Order Messages for Simple Operations

Incorrect:
```php
$users->each(function (User $user) {
    $user->markAsVip();
});
```

Correct: `$users->each->markAsVip();`

Works with `each`, `map`, `sum`, `filter`, `reject`, `contains`, etc.

## Choose `cursor()` vs. `lazy()` Correctly

- `cursor()` — one model in memory, but cannot eager-load relationships (N+1 risk).
- `lazy()` — chunked pagination returning a flat LazyCollection, supports eager loading.

Incorrect: `User::with('roles')->cursor()` — eager loading silently ignored.

Correct: `User::with('roles')->lazy()` for relationship access; `User::cursor()` for attribute-only work.

## Use `lazyById()` When Updating Records While Iterating

`lazy()` uses offset pagination — updating records during iteration can skip or double-process. `lazyById()` uses `id > last_id`, safe against mutation.

## Use `toQuery()` for Bulk Operations on Collections

Avoids manual `whereIn` construction.

Incorrect: `User::whereIn('id', $users->pluck('id'))->update([...]);`

Correct: `$users->toQuery()->update([...]);`

## Use `#[CollectedBy]` for Custom Collection Classes

More declarative than overriding `newCollection()`.

```php
#[CollectedBy(UserCollection::class)]
class User extends Model {}
```
